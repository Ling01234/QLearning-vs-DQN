# Q Learning vs DQN

This is a Pytorch implementation of the Q Learning and Deep Q Network algorithms. The two algorithms are tested against each other in two games from the OpenAI gym environment: CartPole and Lunar Lander. To run the models and see the results, simply run

```python main.py```

in the main directory. The plots will be automatically saved in the `plots` folder. For more information about the implementation, please visit the report [here](https://github.com/Ling01234/QLearning-vs-DQN/blob/master/Report/Report.pdf).
