# AC
- plotting total rewards a lot of squiggles, even if it goes upwards over time

# SAC
- get robust and stable learning in continuous action space environments
- more smooth upward trend, since it maximizes not only the total reward over time, but also the stochasticity/entropy of how the agent behaves
